In Prisma (and databases in general), **indexes** are special data structures that make it faster to look up and filter data.

### What these mean:

#### 1. `@@index([sessionToken])`

- This creates an index on the `sessionToken` column.
- **Why?** When a user makes a request with a session token (e.g., via cookie or header), your server must quickly find the matching session. Without an index, the database might scan the entire table, which gets slow as it grows.
- With an index, the lookup is much faster—similar to using a table of contents in a book instead of reading every page.

#### 2. `@@index([expiresAt])`

- This creates an index on the `expiresAt` column.
- **Why?** If you frequently query or clean up expired sessions (e.g., `DELETE FROM Session WHERE expiresAt < now()`), this helps the database find expired rows quickly instead of scanning everything.

### General Points About Indexes

- **Pros**: Speed up reads/searches dramatically for indexed columns.
- **Cons**: Slightly slower writes/updates (because the index must also update).
- **Common uses**: On fields you filter by often (`WHERE email = ?`, `WHERE token = ?`, etc.), or for foreign keys used in relations.

Would you like me to **show all the fields in this schema where indexes are recommended** for better performance? Or **explain unique constraints vs indexes**?

Good question – deciding where to place indexes is about **balancing read performance with write costs**. Here’s how you can decide where to put indexes in your schema:

### **When to add an index**

1. **Fields you frequently search or filter by**

   - Example: `WHERE email = ?`, `WHERE token = ?`, `WHERE expiresAt < now()`.
   - In your schema:

     - `User.email` (already unique).
     - `Session.sessionToken` (you’ll look up sessions by token).
     - `Session.expiresAt` (you’ll regularly clean up expired sessions).

2. **Foreign keys used in relations**

   - If you often fetch related records.
   - In your schema:

     - `Profile.userId`
     - `Post.authorId`
     - `Session.userId`
     - `Account.userId`

3. **Sorting and pagination**

   - Example: if you sort posts by `createdAt`, indexing `createdAt` can help.

4. **Composite indexes** (multiple fields together)

   - Example: `@@unique([provider, providerAccountId])` in `Account` ensures uniqueness and speeds lookups for OAuth accounts.

### **When NOT to index**

- **Fields that change very often** (high write/update cost).
- **Fields rarely used in queries** (extra storage and overhead for no benefit).
- **Very small tables** (index overhead may not matter).

### **Your schema (best places for indexes)**

Here are some recommended indexes for your schema:

```prisma
model User {
  id                      String     @id @default(uuid())
  email                   String     @unique // already indexed
  role                    Role       @default(USER)
  verificationToken       String?    @index
  resetPasswordToken      String?    @index
  createdAt               DateTime   @default(now()) @index
  ...
}

model Session {
  id           String   @id @default(uuid())
  userId       String   @index
  sessionToken String   @unique // unique also creates an index
  expiresAt    DateTime @index
}

model Post {
  id         String   @id @default(uuid())
  authorId   String   @index
  createdAt  DateTime @index
}

model Profile {
  userId String @unique // unique also creates an index
}

model Account {
  provider          String
  providerAccountId String
  @@unique([provider, providerAccountId]) // composite index
  userId            String   @index
}
```

---

### Quick decision checklist

Ask these questions for each field:

- **Will I use this field in a `WHERE` clause or join?** → Index it.
- **Will I sort or paginate on this field often?** → Index it.
- **Is it a unique identifier or foreign key?** → Index it.
- **Is this a large table where lookups could be slow?** → Index likely helps.
