In your Prisma schema, you have two models: `User` and `Profile`. Here's how the relationship works step by step:

### **1. Relationship Type**

- This is a **one-to-one** relationship:

  - **One `User` has one `Profile`**.
  - **One `Profile` belongs to one `User`**.

### **2. How It’s Defined**

- **In `Profile` model**:

  ```prisma
  userId String @unique
  user   User   @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
  ```

  - `userId` is a **foreign key** that references `User.id`.
  - `@unique` ensures each `Profile` can belong to only one `User`.
  - `@relation` defines how the connection is made:

    - `fields: [userId]` → local foreign key field in `Profile`.
    - `references: [id]` → points to the primary key in `User`.

- **In `User` model**:

  ```prisma
  profile Profile?
  ```

  - `Profile?` means it’s optional; a `User` may or may not have a `Profile`.

### **3. How This Works in Prisma**

- When you create a `Profile`, you must link it to an existing `User` via the `userId`.
- Prisma enforces referential integrity, so `userId` must always point to a valid `User.id`.

### **4. Example Usage**

**Creating a User and Profile:**

```ts
const newUser = await prisma.user.create({
  data: {
    name: "Alice",
    email: "alice@example.com",
    profile: {
      create: {
        bio: "Software Engineer",
        avatarUrl: "https://example.com/alice.png",
        age: 30,
      },
    },
  },
  include: { profile: true },
});
```

**Fetching a User with their Profile:**

```ts
const user = await prisma.user.findUnique({
  where: { email: "alice@example.com" },
  include: { profile: true },
});
```

**Creating a Profile for an existing User:**

```ts
await prisma.profile.create({
  data: {
    userId: "some-user-id",
    bio: "Hello, I'm Alice!",
  },
});
```

### **5. Why Use `Profile` Separately?**

- Keeps user core data (`email`, `password`, `role`) separate from extended information (`bio`, `avatarUrl`).
- Makes schema flexible for growth; you could add more profile fields without cluttering the `User` table.

Would you like me to also **explain the `posts`, `sessions`, and `accounts` relationships** in this model and how they work?
