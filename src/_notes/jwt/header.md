When someone says **“something attached with the header”** in the context of JWT or HTTP requests, they usually mean **data is being sent in the HTTP request headers**.

In APIs, the **header** is a section of the HTTP request that carries metadata about the request or response. It's not part of the body; it's extra information the server uses to understand the request.

---

### **JWT Example – Attached in Header**

When you send a JWT to the server, it’s usually sent in the **Authorization header**:

```
Authorization: Bearer <your_jwt_token_here>
```

- **Authorization** → Header name
- **Bearer** → Tells the server the type of token
- **\<your_jwt_token_here>** → The actual token

This means **the JWT is “attached” with the header** and not sent in the body or URL.

---

### **Why Use Headers for JWT?**

1. Keeps the body clean (body is usually for request data like form inputs).
2. Standardized location for authentication data.
3. Many libraries and frameworks automatically read tokens from headers.

---

### **Other Things That Can Be Attached to Headers**

- **Content-Type:** Tells server what kind of data you are sending (JSON, form, etc.).
- **Accept:** Tells server what response format you want.
- **Custom Headers:** Example: `x-api-key: abc123`

Would you like me to **show a Node.js/Express example of sending JWT in headers** and **verifying it on the server**?
Great question! Let’s break it down step by step so you can clearly understand **how requests and responses work between a client and server**, and what “server” and “client” mean.

---

## **1. What is a Client?**

- **Client** is the software or device that **makes a request** to get data or perform an action.
- Examples:

  - A web browser (Chrome, Firefox)
  - A mobile app
  - Another server making an API call

- The client’s job is to **ask** for something, like:
  _“Give me the user profile for user 123.”_

---

## **2. What is a Server?**

- **Server** is a computer or application that **listens for requests** and **sends responses**.
- It usually hosts your application logic and database.
- The server’s job is to **respond**:
  _“Here’s the user profile for user 123.”_
- Servers run code (e.g., Node.js, Python, Java) and often connect to a **database** (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB).

---

## **3. How Request and Response Work (Flow)**

**Basic flow:**

1. **Client sends a request** to the server.
2. **Server receives the request**, processes it, maybe talks to a database.
3. **Server sends a response** back to the client.
4. **Client shows the result** (e.g., displays it in the browser).

---

### **Example in a Website**

1. **You open a website** → Browser (client) sends a GET request:

   ```
   GET https://example.com/profile
   ```

2. **Server receives it** and finds the data for your profile.
3. **Server responds with HTML/JSON**:

   ```json
   {
     "name": "Vipin",
     "email": "vipin@example.com"
   }
   ```

4. **Browser displays the information.**

---

### **Example in an API Call (JWT Included)**

1. Client (React app) wants user data. It sends a request with a token:

   ```
   GET /api/user
   Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJI...
   ```

2. Server checks the token, fetches user info from the database.
3. Server sends a response:

   ```json
   {
     "id": "123",
     "name": "Vipin Singh"
   }
   ```

4. React app shows the data on the screen.

---

## **4. What Happens Internally**

- **HTTP protocol**: Client and server talk using HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol).
- **Request contains**: URL, method (GET, POST), headers, optional body.
- **Response contains**: Status code (200 OK, 404 Not Found), headers, body (data).

---

### **Request Example**

```
POST /api/login HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJI...

{
  "email": "vipin@example.com",
  "password": "123456"
}
```

### **Response Example**

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR..."
}
```

Would you like me to **draw a simple diagram showing client → server → database flow**? Or **write a small Node.js/Express code example of request/response with JWT**?
